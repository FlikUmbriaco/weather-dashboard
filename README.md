# weather-dashboard
weather dashboard project for class.

As a bootcamp student, I wanted to use Bootstrap, Jquerry, and OpenWeather to create weather dashbord. I built this project to gain a better understanding of how to utalize third party API's in my web pages. Also how to utalize multiple .js and .html files in one page/ The webpage acts as a coding quiz During this project, I learned about how to combine JS, CSS, and HTML
